Read the Paper: 

The dataset being introduced contains shopping information from 10 different shopping malls between 2021and 2023. The data was gathered from various age groups and genders, providing a comprehensive view ofshopping habits in Istanbul.

Included in the dataset are essential pieces of information such as Invoice numbers, Customer IDs, Age,Gender, Payment methods, Product categories, Quantity, Price, Order dates, and Shopping mall locations.

I should note that the dataset presented is intended for exploratory analysis purposes. As such, I believe itcan serve as a starting point for further investigation into shopping behaviors in Istanbul. The data containedis raw and unprocessed, allowing me to develop my own unique insights and interpretations. I intend toapproach the data with an open mind, as the patterns and trends I uncover may be unexpected.
